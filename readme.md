# long-weekend calculator

Shows a list of possible long-weekends based on some params.

### To run the project:
- git clone
- serve the project root so the `index.html` file is served

### To play with the project:
- git clone
- run `sudo chmod +x watcher` from terminal on the root folder
- then in terminal: `/.watcher/`
- serve `/index.html` using some live-server (vs code live server, maybe)
- start modifying the files

The watcher will automatically compile your changes and the live server will refresh the browser serving the `index.html` file.

If you want to build the project, use the `build` file. (again, chmod +x the `build` file and then run it in terminal)
